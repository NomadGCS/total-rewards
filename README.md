** How to make changes **
Any pushes to the master branch will kick off a githubs default automated build and deploy process for github pages.  So anytime you push to master, the changes will go live.  Sidenote - there are no custom ci/cd scripts for this, its all out of the box github pages ci/cd.

**ðŸ”¥ Important**
- This repository needs to be PUBLIC so it can be hosted on github pages.  This page is referenced by MARKETING on the NomadGCS public website.
