** How to make changes **
Any pushes to the master branch will kick off github's default automated build and deploy process for github pages.  So anytime you push to master, the changes will go live.  Sidenote - there are no custom ci/cd scripts for this, its all out of the box github pages ci/cd.

**ðŸ”¥ Important**
- This repository needs to be PUBLIC so it can be hosted on github pages.  This page is referenced by MARKETING on the NomadGCS public website.
- There is no test environment (and doesn't need to be at this point).
- The UI/UX needs to match the public nomadgcs website as this is just an extension of that site.  Have Marketing review if you are unsure.
- HR and Marketing are the owners of this app so any changes need their approval.
